## Description

The main topic of ths lecture is Gaussian Process regression: how to specify the statistical model, how to train it, how to asses it, and how to perform model choice. 

### Readings :
	- Rasmussen, Carl Edward. "Gaussian processes in machine learning." In Advanced lectures on machine learning, pp. 63-71. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2004.
